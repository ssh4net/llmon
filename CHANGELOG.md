# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

## 0.5.2

- LIMITS cards: the 5-hour line shows used / remaining, like the weekly
  line.

## 0.5.1

- COST: the BY PROJECT list has a selected row (Up/Down, the wheel, or a
  click) that highlights a project with its cost, and it scrolls through
  every project.

## 0.5.0

Codex and Claude Code in one monitor.

- Claude Code support, ported from ClaudeMon: token usage from the
  transcripts (each API response counted once, at its final usage), session
  history with subagent transcripts, and live limits from the
  `llmon statusline [--wrap]` subcommand or the opt-in OAuth endpoint
  (`--claude-limits`).
- Usage of logs that are deleted or moved away is kept in
  `llmon-archive.db`, for every harness.
- A COMBINED / CODEX / CLAUDE switch (`h`, or the header pills) on USAGE,
  MODELS, COST, ACTIVITY, and HISTORY. The combined USAGE view stacks both
  card groups and puts the Codex and Claude charts side by side on the same
  days.
- Each harness has its own color theme: select a chart or its cards (click,
  or `x`) and pick a swatch (or `c`).
- New MODELS screen (tokens per day per model) and COST screen (cost by
  day, model, and project) with built-in Codex and Claude price tables and
  `pricing` overrides in `config.json`.
- The Claude LIMITS card uses the Codex card layout, weekly limit first.
- The Claude INPUT column is total input, as for Codex; the token heading
  sits over its columns.
- A log whose last line was cut off (for example by a crash) no longer
  keeps indexing pending.

## 0.1.0

- Renamed comon to llmon, the start of the merge of comon (Codex) and
  ClaudeMon (Claude Code) into one monitor; see `PLAN.md`. Version reset to
  0.1.0.
- Renamed the binary, crate, state directory (`~/.llmon`, `LLMON_HOME`,
  `--llmon-home`), cache database (`llmon.db`), and install/package scripts.
  Existing `~/.comon` data is not read yet; a migration command is planned.
- Fixed the remaining clippy warnings and added a CI workflow that runs
  clippy and the tests on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

The entries below are from comon, llmon's predecessor.

## comon (unreleased)

- Fixed musl builds by requesting only the numeric and time locale categories
  used by CoMon instead of the unavailable musl `libc::LC_ALL_MASK` binding.
- Deep/Full History repository discovery is now opt-in: startup uses only the
  cached catalog, new configurations have no discovery roots, and `r`/`F5`
  presents the exact roots and limits for confirmation before a filesystem scan.
- Applied each Weekly pace warning style to the full limit line. Normal and
  Yellow use text colors; Orange and Red use white text on warning backgrounds.
- Aligned the Limits gauge with reset-anchored daily allowance warnings and
  retained matching filled-divider colors.
- Moved the reset action from the Limits card to the reset-credit summary, with
  a wrapped narrow-layout position, white summary text, and the
  same click and hover behavior.
- Added six persisted half-channel RGB accent themes and ordered all color
  swatches through a red-to-green-to-blue-to-red rainbow.
- Fixed project attribution to use recorded session context only: sandbox permissions, tool working directories, and referenced command paths cannot create project memberships or relink Session history. The v12 cache migration rebuilds derived usage from raw session logs.

## 0.5.8 - 2026-09-27

- Simplified the white reset-credit summary to `LIMIT RESETS: N available ...`.
- Weekly limits now show used / remaining percentages in full and compact views.
- Shortened the daily-usage tooltip to four lines, preserving daily allowance,
  carryover, reset countdown, and status-specific advice.

## 0.5.7 - 2026-09-24

- The weekly Limits gauge now matches the daily-allowance warning status:
  white, yellow, orange, or red, including unused allowance carried forward.
- Moved its marker to today's cumulative allowance instead of continuous
  elapsed-week pacing. Monthly gauges remain neutral white.

## 0.5.6 - 2026-09-24

- Added one cell of padding to both sides of the top information and control
  rows on every screen, including matching button hit areas and summary wrapping.

## 0.5.5 - 2026-09-24

- Split the Usage chart's total/non-cached token pair into three aligned columns:
  input, non-cached input, and output. Bar lengths still represent total tokens.

## 0.4.4 - 2026-07-26

- Placed APISTAT immediately after USAGE and aligned its header, live-limits card, server-total cards, and reset-credit summary with the Usage dashboard.
- Moved the Activity, Limits, and History header rows between one blank line above and below their status information.

## 0.4.3 - 2026-07-22

- Added a persisted `n` shortcut to cycle display formatting through Classic, System Compact, and System Full for numbers, dates, times, and calendar labels.
- Clarified token pair charts with the `TOKENS (TOTAL / NON-CACHED)` heading.
- Added compact `K/M/B/T` notation for large dashboard token values in System Compact mode, including values inside vertical chart bars. System Full keeps those values expanded, while Classic output remains unchanged.
- Added mouse controls for selecting the visible statistic, chart timeframe, chart orientation, screen, and display style.
- Restored compact one-line control strips on the Usage and Activity screens and highlighted the padded group labels with the chart's darker cyan.
- Removed duplicate shortcut hints from screen headers, leaving the complete shortcut reference in the footer and help overlay.
- Added clickable screen tabs to the outer title and matching framed View/Projects controls to the Activity screen.
- System Full now groups expanded integers with regular spaces while retaining system-localized dates, times, and decimals.
- Added a compact `STYLE CLASS/SCOMP/SFULL` selector after the Usage bar controls and a bottom-border Quit action with a safe Yes/No confirmation dialog; the `q` shortcut opens the same dialog.
- Added the current locale-aware date and time to the `TODAY` card border.
- Vertical chart values now compact only when an individual bar is too narrow, with an exact locale-aware value tooltip on mouse hover.
- Exit confirmation can be disabled from the quit dialog, persists in `state.json`, and can be re-enabled through the confirmed checkbox beside `QUIT`.

## 0.3.6 - 2026-06-05

- Added `--live-limits auto|on|off` so app-only installs can run without a live-limits spawn error.
- Added `--app-server-bin` for standalone Codex App Server executables.
- Added Windows auto-detection for common Codex App bundled App Server locations.
- Project activity token headers now show total/out-of-cache token pairs.
- Documented the musl C compiler requirement for portable Linux builds.

## 0.3.4 - 2026-04-24

- Fixed inflated usage totals from forked/subagent session logs by ignoring replayed parent-session token history while preserving new post-fork usage.
- Bumped the scan-cache schema to reparse stale forked-session cache rows.

## 0.3.3 - 2026-03-18

- Added a built-in Session history screen to the main `comon` TUI:
  - Project list grouped by session `cwd`
  - Session list with derived titles from user prompts
  - Session detail view with prompt previews, token counts, tool-call counts, and git metadata when present
- Added runtime screen switching:
  - `s` / `F2` now toggles between Usage and Session history without restarting the app
  - `r` / `F5` refreshes the active screen and rebuilds the sessions catalog on the Session history screen
- Added session-browser CLI options:
  - `--read` starts directly on the Session history screen
  - `--sessions-dir` overrides the scanned Codex sessions tree
  - `--print-sessions-dir` prints the effective sessions directory and exits
- Hardened startup behavior for session browsing:
  - Missing default `CODEX_HOME/sessions` now opens an empty Session history view instead of failing startup

## 0.3.2 - 2026-02-17

- Fixed workspace startup scoping:
  - `comon` without `--project` now always uses **All workspaces**, even when launched inside a repo.
  - A non-git `--project` now disables repo filtering, even if launch dir is inside a repo.
  - `--cwd` now only controls app-server launch directory and never changes usage scope.
  - `comon` no longer restores a stale last workspace filter when no workspace hint is detected.
- Hardened long-history backfill behavior:
  - `--full-scan --scan-time-budget-ms 0` now forces full reparse instead of trusting unchanged cache rows.
  - Full scan now ignores planner file/byte caps.
- Added regression tests for:
  - workspace selection precedence
  - full-scan stale-cache repair
  - append-only file resume via cached file offsets

## 0.3.0 - 2026-02-16

- Added incremental session parsing with persisted offsets and parser state in `comon.db`.
- Reduced restart regressions: unchanged files outside current scan plan now stay visible via cache.
- Added `--scan-time-budget-ms` for bounded per-refresh parse time (`0` disables budget).
- Added `--max-jsonl-line-kib` to cap parsed line size without hard-dropping large files.
- Added cache DB schema migration (`v1 -> v2`) for offset/parser-state fields.
- For historical backfill after copying older sessions, run once:
  - `comon --full-scan --scan-time-budget-ms 0`
